> ***RARE*** is a unified framework designed to automatically generate synthetic, dynamic, and time-sensitive corpora for testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using domain-specific unstructured datasets. It also provides a benchmark that thoroughly evaluates the robustness of RAG systems under various perturbations.

## ✨  Key Features

- ***RARE*-Get**: a novel dynamic synthesis pipeline that automatically constructs time-sensitive evaluation data through knowledge graph triplet extraction and traversal techniques, enabling the creation of single-hop and multi-hop tuples (question, answer, ground truth chunks) at various complexity levels without manual curation from unstructured dataset.
- ***RARE*-Set**: a large-scale benchmark comprising over 400 specialized documents and 48,322 queries across financial, economics, and policy domains
- ***RARE*-Met**: a comprehensive robustness evaluation metric for measuring RAG system performance under perturbations to queries, documents, and simulated real-world retrieval results.

## 📦  Installation

Strongly recommend using miniconda:

```bash
conda create -n rare python=3.12
```

Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/RARE.git && cd RARE
```
